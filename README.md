A fork of the older remastersys scripts used to create Bodhi Linux ISO images.

Updates/Changes:
- Support for UEFI booting if [bodhi-uefi-data](http://packages.bodhilinux.com/bodhi/pool/main/b/bodhi-uefi-data/) package is present
- Updated compression method to xz to decrease image sizes
- Stripped out generic remastersys namings and replaced with Bodhi information
